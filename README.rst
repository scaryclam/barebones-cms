Barebones CMS
=============

This is a very simple service orientated CMS.

It is not meant to be a complete CMS solution, just the base
for projects to use when the project does not want or need 
something as complete as DjangoCMS.

Issues should be tracked on Mantis, though issues that are ***not***
to do with the basic CMS should be tracked against the project that
extended things.
